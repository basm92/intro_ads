## Assignment 3: Collaborating Together 

In this assignment, you will analyze a dataset of X collaborations. What's more, you will pair up with a class mate and contribute to each other's document. Afterwards, you will host this document online, preferably on your Github repository, from which I will download and grade it. 

- This time, make sure to not only put your name and student e-mail in your Rmarkdown header, but also your Github account, as I have done myself.
